# Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create the file that stores the password
✦ Create a new folder called `.streamlit` at the root of the project folder
✦ Add a new file `secrets.toml` in the new folder

## Step 2: Add password to secrets.toml
```toml
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
password = "rules123
```

## Step 3: File Structure
```
your_project/
├── .streamlit/
│   └── secrets.toml      # Contains password (DO NOT COMMIT)
├── utility.py           # Password protection utility (provided script)
├── housing_app.py       # Main application  
├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
└── .gitignore          # Must include .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

## Step 4: Update .gitignore
Make sure `.streamlit/secrets.toml` is in your `.gitignore` file:
```
# Streamlit secrets - NEVER commit this!
.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

## How it works:
✅ Password stored securely in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
✅ OpenAI API key entered manually in sidebar each session
✅ Uses exact utility.py script as provided
✅ Clean password prompt (just "Password" field)
✅ Safe for public repositories when properly configured
